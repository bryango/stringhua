				"Entanglement Entropy in TTbar-Deformed CFT"<br/><br/>
				<em>Abstract:</em> The TTbar-deformation of CFT presents an one-parameter class of integrable quantum field theory. In this talk, I would like to give a brief review on the recent development of TTbar deformed 2D CFT. In particular, I will discuss the holographic dual of the deformed CFT, and introduce our recent work on the entanglement entropy in the TTbar deformed CFT.

Further, borrowing from the string theory tool- kit, I will present a holographic model that relieves the tension and predicts a turning point in the Hubble parameter at small redshift.

		"Modular Berry Connection in CFT and Transport in AdS"<br/><br/>
		<em>Abstract:</em> A leading hypothesis about the emergence of a gravitational bulk spacetime in holographic duality is that spacetime is built out of quantum entanglement in the boundary theory. I will review one example of how the bulk "geometrizes" the boundary entanglement: lengths of spacelike curves in AdS3 compute a boundary quantity called differential entropy, which appropriately isolates IR contributions to entanglement entropies of CFT subregions. I will then explain a novel perspective on this older story: that differential entropy (and lengths of curves in AdS) are manifestations of the famous Berry phase -- a quantum phase, generated by a sequence of changing modular Hamiltonians in the CFT. As an illustration, we will look at the transport of CFT operators called OPE blocks (geodesic operators in AdS), where the Berry connection generates translations in AdS. A conjecture is that bulk transport in holography, perhaps in all generality, originates from modular Berry transformations.

				<em>Abstract:</em> Compact manifolds with the exceptional holonomy groups G_2 and Spin(7) can be used in M-Theory to geometrically engineer theories in 4D and 3D
	with minimal supersymmetry. Building on new results in mathematics, we
	review recent progress in the construction of such geometries, the
	associated physics, and dualities to other string compactifications.

					“Quantum Aspects of Black Holes” <br/><br/>
					<em>Abstract:</em> Although there is direct experimental evidence for the existence of black holes from the recent measurements of gravitational waves,  black holes are still mysterious objects from the theoretical point of view. According to the seminal work of Stephen Hawking, all information about the collapsing matter that forms a black hole is lost during the evaporation of Hawking radiation. This loss of information is in sharp conflict with the rules of quantum mechanics. It is also closely related to the no hair theorem of classical black holes, which states a black hole cannot carry any other quantum numbers other than its mass, charge or its angular momentum. Hence it is mandatory to understand in a quantum theory of gravity what are the carriers of information in a black hole and which kind of quantum hair can be attributed to black holes. In this talk,  I will first review how the quantum entropy of  black holes emerges in string theory. Furthermore, I will also discuss a complementary picture for the hair of neutral Schwarzschild black holes. This part is based on some recent developments related to asymptotic symmetries in gravity. Finally I give some remarks on black holes as quantum computers.

				"Non-geometric fluxes and non-associativity in string/M-theory"<br/><br/>
				<em>Abstract:</em> In this talk I will discuss compactifications with geometric and non-geometric fluxes in string and in M-theory. These can be described by generalized geometry, double field theory and exceptional field theory. In particular I will discuss how non-geometric fluxes lead to a non-associative phase space structure, which is closely related to the non-associative algebra of the imaginary octonions.

It allows to identify the doubled space with a Drinfeld double and provides a powerful tool to extract the transformation of the metric, B-field, dilaton and R/R potentials under Poisson-Lie T-duality.

				<em>Abstract:</em> I will discuss a new quantum anomaly for rigid supersymmetry on even dimensional curved backgrounds that admit Killing spinors and will show how it is related to the superconfomal anomalies that are determined by the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions. I will then explore the implications of this anomaly for the dependence of supersymmetric partition functions on the geometric data of the background, for the supersymmetric Casimir energy, as well as for supersymmetric localization.

		"Fiber-base duality and 3d dualities"<br/><br/>
		<em>Abstract:</em> 5d supersymmetric gauge theories often admit (p,q) web construction, and therefore enjoy the fiber-base duality which descends from the IIB S-duality. Such duality further leads to dualities in lower dimensional gauge theories. In this talk I will discuss simple examples where 5d fiber-base duality reduces to 3d mirror symmetry of gauge theories on intersecting spaces, and also possible connections to 3d-3d correspondence.

		"New structures and formulations for S-matrices"<br/><br/>
		<em>Abstract:</em> In the past decades and especially the last one, powerful new tools and remarkable new structures for perturbative scattering amplitudes in QFT have been discovered. Apart from playing a prominent role in high-energy particle physics, these developments have important implications for a wide range of subjects: from string perturbation theory to multi-loop calculations in (super)-gravity, from new mathematics to all-loop amplitudes in N=4 SYM. I will review some recent progress, focusing on two topics: (1) a string-inspired new formulation for amplitudes in gauge theories and gravity, and "double-copy” between them (2) new geometric structures underlying amplitudes which may hint at a ``theory at infinity” for S-matrices.

		"Warped Black Holes in Lower-Spin Gravity"<br/><br/>
		<em>Abstract:</em>  In this talk I will talk about recent work (1801.07263) showing that (spacelike) warped AdS_3 black hole solutions can be consistently described in a lower-spin gravity theory. This model provides a very simple playground to explore warped black holes and at the same time warped conformal field theories at finite temperature. I will put an emphasis on the basic ideas that are needed to translate geometric statements into a gauge-theoretic language as well as how to compute the thermodynamic properties of warped black holes in this theory.

			"Holographic Symplectic forms and extremal volumes: a new York time story"<br/><br/>
			<em>Abstract:</em>   In this talk, I will explain how the gravitational symplectic form between nearby AAdS geometries is dual to a quantum Kahler form on the space of euclidean path integral states with sources turned on. As an application, I will show that variations of extremal volumes can be computed using this symplectic form by considering a particular variation: the “new York” variation, which I will describe in detail. Finally, I will discuss the CFT interpretation of this deformation in some concrete examples like the vacuum and the TFD state at late times.

In the first half of the talk, we explain what has been done to establish BBM.In the second half, we explain how BBM and its generalizations make contact with various mathematical objects such as colored quivers and a co-associative 4-cycle in a manifold with a G2 structure.

			“Homotopy Algebras in Higher Spin Theory” <br/><br/>
			<em>Abstract:</em> Motivated by string field theory, we explain various algebraic aspects of higher spin theory and Vasiliev equation in terms of homotopy algebras. We present a systematic study of unfolded formulation developed for the higher spin equation in terms of the Maurer-Cartan equation associated to differential forms valued in L-infinity algebras. The elimination of auxiliary variables of Vasiliev equation is analyzed through homological perturbation theory. We also discover a topological quantum mechanics model whose correlation functions give deformed higher spin vertices at first order. This is joint work with Keyou Zeng
